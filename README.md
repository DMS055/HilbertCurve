# HilbertCurves

A simple Java program for visualising the Hilbert's Curve (a space-filling curve) written using the Processing 3 evniorment.

**This is not a pure Java project, it doesn't include a grphic lib, it uses the default one from Processing 3, so it won't work if run as an independent file!**
